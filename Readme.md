##### What is Bitcoin?
> Bitcoin offers an efficient means of transferring money over the internet and is controlled by a decentralized network with a transparent set of rules, thus presenting an alternative to central bank-controlled fiat money.
##### Advantage of Bitcoin:
>	By using a cryptocurrency, users are able to exchange value digitally without third party oversight
##### Problem Faced by Users:
> The main Issue with Bitcoin is that it is "FICKLE THING" and its value changes every minute.
